# Problem Statement
Many people find it difficult to organise their daily meals in a methodical and health-conscious manner.  It can be difficult to keep track of nutritional intake, estimate meal costs, and identify necessary ingredients—especially for students, working professionals, and anyone leading a busy lifestyle.
 A straightforward, lightweight tool is required to assist users in selecting meals, comprehending their financial and nutritional implications, and creating a combined grocery list without the need for sophisticated apps or paid services.

# Scope of the Project

● Offering a seamless text-based user experience that works on any system with Python
