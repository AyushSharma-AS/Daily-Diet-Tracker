# Project Title 
Daily Diet Tracker

# Overview
A Python-based command-line tool called Daily Diet Tracker was created to assist users in making more intelligent, healthful, and well-organised meal choices.  The application helps the user plan their daily meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and offers a carefully chosen list of Indian dishes, each with comprehensive nutritional data and an estimated cost.

 Once the meals have been chosen, the program automatically creates:
 i) A grocery list that includes the frequency of ingredients
 ii) An overview of nutrition that includes daily protein and caloric intake
 iii) An estimate of daily expenses based on specific meals
 iv) A simple, readable summary of the meal plan
 The project is both useful and beginner-friendly because it demonstrates effective use of Python fundamentals like data structures, loops, input handling, and formatted console output.

 # Features
i) Interactive Meal Planning:
Select meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner from an Indian cuisine menu.

ii) Automatic Grocery List Builder:
Consolidates all ingredients required for the day, avoiding duplicates.

iii) Nutritional Analysis:
Calculates and displays total daily calories and protein intake.

iv) Cost Tracking:
Estimates the total cost of your chosen daily meals.

v) Clean & Structured Output:
User-friendly formatting for summaries and meal plans.

vi) Built-In Error Handling
Guides users when invalid inputs are entered.

# Technologies & Tools Used
1. Python 3.13
2. Standard Python features only:
   
      i) Dictionaries for structured recipe data.
  
      ii) Loops & conditionals for core logic.
  
      iii) Input validation for reliable user interaction.
  
      iv) String formatting for clean terminal output.

# Installation & Running the Project
1. Clone the Repository:

     git clone https://github.com/AyushSharma-AS/Daily-Diet-Tracker
   
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

     cd Daily-Diet-Tracker
   
4. Run the Application:

     python Daily_Diet_Tracker.py

# Instructions for Testing
In order to properly evaluate the Daily Diet Tracker:

 1. To see the meal menu, run the script.

 2. Enter valid meal numbers for the following when prompted:

     Breakfast

     Lunch

     Dinner

 3. To test how the program handles errors, try entering invalid inputs (letters, symbols, and out-of-range numbers).

 4. Check the outputs that were produced:

     Accuracy of grocery lists

     Counts of ingredients

     Correctness of the nutritional summary

     Calculation of costs

     Show formatting

 5. Make sure the interaction is error-free, intuitive, and seamless overall.
